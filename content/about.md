My name is Darwin D. Wu and I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco.

I'm a self-taught engineer, graduated with a Political Science/Economics degree but have felt in love with software engineering since my senior year and have made the jump into this world.

I'm mostly what people call a Full-Stack engineer and DevOps/SRE, but currently more focus on the backend and ops side these days. Interested in all kinds of technologies, especially operating systems, compilers and the lower level stuff.

And I love Rust. :)
